NeuroMap installation MPFI

(1) checkout svn repository

Check out the BarrelField3D svn repository. Got to a directory of your choice and do:

	svn co https://10.1.100.49/svn-repository/BarrelField3D
	
	it will ask for user/password; try the NeuroCount user/password,
	let me know in case that doesn't work.

(2) adjust paths in source code

Open the file BarrelField3D/common/barrel_field.cpp
Go to the function

	void BarrelField::readStandardBarrelField() (line 548)

Change the path names to the absolute path pointing to the standard barrel field files, e.g.

	const char * bfName = "/home/regger/project_src/BarrelField3D/common/average_barrel_field_complete_S1.am";
	
	changes to
	const char * bfName = "/path/to/your/installation/BarrelField3D/common/average_barrel_field_complete_S1.am";

Do this for the seven paths pointing to the files making up the standard barrel field.

(3) configure build

ssh into golgi (simply ssh -X golgi should do it).
Go into the BarrelField3D/NeuroRegistration directory and run:

	ccmake .

This starts the cmake configuration dialog (for more info see http://www.cmake.org/).
Press 'c' to configure. It will do some stuff and then probably give you an error message.
Just press 'e' to get back to the main screen. Now, you can edit the configuration parameters
by moving up and down with the arrow keys and pressing 'enter' and typing to change an entry.
Toggle more options with 't'.

The options that you need to set now are (if they're not set yet):

	CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE	Release
	GSL_CONFIG			/usr/bin/gsl-config
	ITK_DIR				/usr/local/lib/InsightToolkit
	VTK_DIR				/usr/local/VTK-bin-icc/lib/vtk-5.6
	CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER	/usr/local/intel/bin/intel64/icpc

Now, hit 'c' again to re-configure. In case there are new error messages,
go back to the main menu with 'e' as above, make sure the options are still set correctly
(it sometimes changes them again...) and do this back and forth until you see the option
to press 'g' at the bottom. Now, press 'g' to generate the makefile and exit.

(4) compiling

ssh into golgi if you haven't done so.
Start a bash shell if you're not already in one:

	bash

Load all intel shared libraries:

	source /usr/local/intel/bin/iccvars.sh intel64
(NB: this also needs to be done when you want to run the compiled programs,
but you probably already know that.)

Go into the BarrelField3D/NeuroRegistration directory and run:

	make [-j8; optional for parallel compilation] NeuroRegistration

Done!
